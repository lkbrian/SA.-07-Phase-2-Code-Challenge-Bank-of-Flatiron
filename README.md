# Introduction
i started of with creating a react app,followed by creating the db.json 
and the components folder for the required deliverables 
use <code>npm start</code> to run the code <code>npx json-server --watch db.json</code>
for the data to be fetched from the db.json
# Solution
i have 3 components Form,SearchBar and Table. The Search component  filter the transaction
statements based on the category you type in using the filter method form component handles 
adding transactions on to the Table with use of state and event listeners the Table Component 
disaplay all transactions available on our db.json  we fetch the Data using useEffect which  is
used to handle side effects among which is to fetch Data
# Conlusion
it has been to fun to work with states and use effect
